    <button class="collapsible">What is OOPS?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>OOPS is abbreviated as Object Oriented Programming. It is a system in which programs are considered as a collection of objects. Each object is nothing but an instance of a class.</p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">Basic concepts of OOPS</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>Following are the concepts of OOPS
            <ul>
                <li>Abstraction</li>
                <li>Encapsulation</li>

    <button class="collapsible">What is a class</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            A Class is simply a representation of a type of object. It is the blueprint/plan/template that describes the detail of an object.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is an Object</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            An object is an instance of a class. It has its own state, behaviour and identity.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is Encapsulation</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Encapsulation is an attribute of an object. It contains all data which is hidded. That hidded data can be restricted to the members of that class.
            Levels are:
            <ul>
                <li>Public</li>
                <li>Protected</li>
                <li>Private</li>
                <li>Internal</li>
                <li>Protected Internal</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is Inheritance</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Inheritance is a concept where one class shares the structure and behaviour defined in another class. Inheritance applied to one class is called Single Inheritance. Inheritance depending on multiple classes is called Multiple Inheritance.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What are MANIPULATORS</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Manipulators are the functions which can be used in conjunction with the insertion (<<) and extraction (>>) operators on an object. Examples are:
            <ul>
                <li>endl</li>
                <li>setw</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class=collapsible>What is a CONSTRUCTOR</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>A constructor is a method used to initialise the state of an object, and it gets invoked at the time of object creation. Rules for constructor are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>Constructor Name should be the same as aclass name</li>
                <li>A constructor must have no return type</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is DESTRUCTOR</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            A DESCTURCTOR is a method which is automatically called when the object is made of scope or destroyed. Destructor name is also same as class name but with the tilde (~) symbol before the name.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is an INLINE FUNCTION</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            An INLINE FUNCTION is a technique used by the compilers. It instructs to insert complete body of the function whereever that function is used in the program source code.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is a VIRTUAL FUNCTION?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            A VIRTUAL FUNCTION is a member function of a class. Its functionality can be overriden in its derived class. This function can be implemented by using a keyword called virtual.
        </p>
        <p>
            A VIRTUAL FUNCTION can be declared using a token VIRTUAL in C++. It can be achieved in CPP/Python language by using function pointers or pointers to a function.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is a FRIEND FUNCTION?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            A FRIEND FUNCTION is a friend of a class that is allowed to access to PUBLIC, PRIVATE or PROTECTED data in that same class. If the function is defined outside the class cannot access such information.
        </p>

        <p>
            A FRIEND FUNCTION can be declared anywhere in the class declaration, and it cannot  be affected by access control keywords likke PRIVATE, PUBLIC or PROTECTED.
        </p>
    </div>
    
    <button class="collapsible">What is FUNCTION OVERLOADING?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            FUNCTION OVERLOADING is a regular function, but it can perform different tasks. It allows the creation of several methods with the same name which differ from each other by the type of input and output variables of the function.
        </p>
        <p>
            EXAMPLE: </br>
            <code>
                void add(int&amp;amp; a, int&amp;amp; b); </br>
                void add(double&amp;amp; a, double&amp;amp; b); </br>
                void add(struct bob&amp;amp; a, struct bob&amp;amp; b); </br>
            </code>
        </p>
    </div>

        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is ABSTRACT CLASS</button>
    <div class="content">
        An abstract class is a class which cannot be instatiated. Creation of an object is not possible with an abstract class, but it can be inherited. An abstract class can contain only an ABSTRACT method. JAVA allows only abstract method in abstract class while other languages allow non-abstract method as well.
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is a TERNARY OPERATOR?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The TERNARY OPERATOR is said to be an operator which takes three arguments. It is a part of the syntax for basic conditional expressions. It is commonly referred to as the <strong>conditional operator, inline if /iif/ or ternary if</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            SYNTAX </br>
            <code>
                variable = condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false </br>
            </code>
        </p>

        <p>
            EXAMPLE </br>
            <code>
                int opening_time = (day==SUNDAY) ? 12 : 9;
            </code>
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is the use of FINALIZE method</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            FINALIZE method helps to perform cleanup operations on the resources which are not currently used. Finalize method is PROTECTED, and it is accessible only through this class of by a DERIVED class.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What are the different types of arguments?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            A parameter is a variable used during the declaration of the function or subroutine, and arguments are passed to the function body. They should match with the parameters defined.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are two types of ARGUMENTS:
            <ul>
                <li>Call by VALUE : value passed will get modified only inside the function, and it returns the same value whatever it is passed into the function</li>
                <li>Call by REFERENCE : value passed will get modified in both inside and outside the functions and it returns the same or different value</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is SUPER keywoard</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The SUPER keywoard is used to invoke the overriden method, which overrides one of its superclass methods. This keyword allows to access overriden methods and also to access hidden members of the superclass.
        </p>

        <p>
            It also forwards a call from a constructor, to a constructor in the superclass.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is SUPER keyword</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            The SUPER keyword is used to invoke the OVERRIDDEN method, which overrides one of its superclass methods. This keyword allows to access overrided methods and also to access hidden members of the superclass.
        </p>

        <p>
            It also forwards a call from a constructor, to a constructor in the superclass.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is method overriding?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Method overriding is a feature that allows a subclass to provide the implementation of a method that overrides in the main class. It will override the implementation in the superclass by providing the same method name, same parameter and same return type.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is an INTERFACE</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            An interface is a collection of an abstract method. If the class implements an interface, if thereby inherits all the abstract methods of an interface.
        </p>
        <p>
            JAVA uses INTERFACE to implement multiple inheritances.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is exception handling</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            An exception is an event that occurs during the execution of a program. Exceptions can be of any type:
            <ul>
                <li>Runtime</li>
                <li>Error</li>
            </ul>
            Those exceptions are adequately handled through exception handling mechanism like: TRY, CATCH and THROW keywords
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What are tokens?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            A compiler recognises a TOKEN and it cannot be broken down into component elements.
        </p>
        <p>
            GENERAL EXAMPLES:
            <ul>

    <button class="collapsible">What is the main difference between OVERLOADING and OVERRIDING</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            OVERLOADING is a STATIC BINDING, whereas OVERRIDING is DYNAMIC BINDING. 
        </p>
        <p>
             OVERLOADING: method with the same name but with different arguments and it may or may not return the equal value in the same class itself.
        </p>
        <p>
            OVERRIDING: method with the same name, the same arguments and return types associated with the class and its child class.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is the main difference between a CLASS and an OBJECT?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            An object is an instance of a class. Objects hold multiple information, but classes do not have any information. Definition of properties and functions can be done in class and can be used the by the object.
        </p>
        <p>
            A CLASS can have sub-classes, while and OBJECT does not have sub-objects.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is an abstraction?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Abstraction is a useful feature of OOPS, and it shows only the necessary details to the client of an object. In other words, it shows only required details for an object, not the inner constructors of an object.
        </p>
        <p>
            EXAMPLE </br>
            When you want to switch on the television, it is not necessary to know the inner circuitry/mechanism needed to switch on the TV.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What are ACCESS MODIFIERS?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            Access modifiers determine the scope of the method or variables that can be accessed from other various objects or classes. There are five types of access modifiers, and they are as follows:
            <ul>
                <li>PRIVATE</li>
                <li>PROTECTED</li>
                <li>PUBLIC</li>
                <li>FRIEND</li>

        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What are SEALED MODIFIERS?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            SEALED MODIFIERS are the ACCESS MODIFIERS where the methods can not inherit it. SEALED MODIFIERS can also be applied to PROPERTIES, EVENTS and METHODS. This MODIFIER cannot be used to STATIC members.
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What are the various types of constructors?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            There are three types of constructors:
            <ul>
                <li>DEFAULT : no parameters</li>
                <li>PARAMETRIC : with parameters; creates a new instance of a class and also passes arguments simultaneusly</li>
                <li>COPY : creates a new object as a copy of an existing object</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
    </div>

    <button class="collapsible">What is EARLY and LATE BINDING?</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>

    <button class="collapsible">What is the difference between STRUCTURE and a CLASS</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            A STRUCTURE is used for grouping DATA, whereas a CLASS can be used for grouping DATA and METHODS. The default access type of a STRUCTURE is PUBLIC, but CLASS access type is PRIVATE.
        </p>
        <p>
            STRUCTURES are exclusively used for DATA, and it does not require strict validation. CLASSES are used to ENCAPSULATE and inherent DATA, which requires strict validation.

    <button class="collapsible">What is a PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            A PURE VIRTUAL FUNCTION is a function which can be overridden in the derived class but cannot be defined. A VIRTUAL FUNCTION can be declared as PURE by using the operator =0
        </p>
        <p>
            EXAMPLE </br>
            <code>

    <button class="collapsible">What is STATIC and DYNAMIC BINDING</button>
    <div class="content">
        <p>
            BINDING is nothing but association of a name with the class. STATIC binding is a BINDING in which name can be associated with the class during compilation time, and it is also called an EARLY BINDING.
        </p>
        <p>
            DYNAMIC BINDING is a binding in which name can be associated with the class during execution time, and it is also called as LATE BINDING.
